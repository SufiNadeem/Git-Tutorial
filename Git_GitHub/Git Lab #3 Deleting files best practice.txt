Best Practice for Deleting Files in Git (Local + GitHub):
Navigate to your local repo on your PC:
==============================================================
STEP 1: 
Open Git Bash in your local repo

STEP 2:
$git rm <full filename> (for example, index.txt.txt)
Note: Use git rm -r foldername/ if you're deleting a folder.
Note: You can also use rm file.txt and then git rm file.txt (or git add -u), but git rm is cleaner.

STEP 3: Commit the change:
$git commit -m "Remove file.txt from project"

STEP 4: Push the changes to GitHub:
$git push origin master
Replace main with your branch name if different.

ðŸ›‘ Donâ€™t:
Donâ€™t manually delete files directly on GitHub via the web and then pull â€” it can cause merge conflicts if the local repo still tracks them.

Donâ€™t forget to commit after deleting, or Git wonâ€™t recognize the change.

Would you like a script to automate this for multiple files or folders?
